Heroes answer those questions not in words, but in actions dictated by their post-Soviet worldview and values.  When Jehovah's Witnesses commit an accidental murder in a search for new religious followers or when the hero rides a motorcycle in memory of his brother, who died in Chechnya — an absurdity connects with reality.
