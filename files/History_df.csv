This project is simultaneously an ode to craftsmanship and to how that changed radically over the course of the 20th century. The precise type of projector, the Iskra NP-21, also calls a complete history to mind, as Iskra was as omnipresent in Tito’s post-war Yugoslavia as Bosch and Miele in the West.
